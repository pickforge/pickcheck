`docs/spec.md` is the contract. Explain deviations in the PR.

Do not lower metric limits, coverage floors or clippy thresholds to get green. Coverage is a ratchet: raise the floor to actual coverage rounded down. Changes to language tables or metric rules need a golden fixture in `tests/fixtures/<language>/expected.json`, including a negative case.

`--changed` uses Git diff post-images plus untracked files, resolved against the repo root. Do not walk the current directory or let `.gitignore` filter that set. Classify syntax by tree-sitter node kinds and fields, never text prefixes or operator substrings.

Loop-guard state lives in `~/.pickforge/complexity-gate/`; `COMPLEXITY_GATE_HOME` overrides it. A workspace version bump also needs the exact `complexity-gate-core` dependency pin in `crates/cli/Cargo.toml`.
