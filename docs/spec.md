# PickCheck (complexity-gate) — specification v1

PickCheck is the product name; it was formerly complexity-gate. The binary,
packages, hook commands, config files, and state paths keep the
`complexity-gate` name, and this contract uses that name for everything that
runs.

One static binary that measures function complexity with tree-sitter and blocks
coding agents from finishing while the functions they
changed exceed the limits. No external linters. Manual counting by a model is
never an accepted measurement.

This document is the contract. Implementation, tests, and the harness package in
`pickforge-platform/packages/complexity-gate` follow it; deviations are reported
in the PR, not decided silently.

## Non-goals

- Exact parity with ESLint, clippy, radon, gocyclo, or DCM. We are deterministic
  and at least as strict as those tools on the golden fixtures; small counting
  differences are expected and documented per language.
- Replacing repo-level CI gates (ESLint/clippy). Those stay; this is the
  agent-side gate.
- Cognitive complexity (v2 candidate).

complexity-gate measures how hard code is to *read*. It does not enforce policy.
Rules of the form "this API is banned", "errors must be typed", "no `any`", or
"no `unwrap()`" belong to clippy, ESLint, oxlint, and `dart analyze`, which
already own them, resolve types, and see the whole program. Such rules need
per-language allowlists and cross-file resolution that a single-file syntactic
analyzer cannot provide honestly, so they stay out of scope even when the
underlying problem is real.

## Metrics (per function)

| Metric | Definition | Default limit |
|---|---|---|
| `complexity` | cyclomatic: `1 + decision points` in the function body, excluding nested functions | 15 |
| `depth` | max nesting of control-flow constructs (see below), nested functions reset to 0 | 4 |
| `lines` | lines from the function's first to last line inclusive, minus blank lines and comment-only lines (every non-whitespace byte inside comment nodes); nested functions included | 100 |
| `params` | declared parameters; a destructuring pattern counts as 1; receiver/`self`/`this` excluded | 6 |
| `bool_ops` | max short-circuit boolean operators in a single expression (see below) | 3 |
| `widget_depth` | Dart only: max nesting of widget constructors in a `build` method (see below) | 7 |

A violation is `value > limit`. Test files (see config) are exempt from `lines`
only.

### Decision points (common rules)

Each of the following adds 1:

- `if`, `else if` / `elif` (a bare `else` adds 0)
- every loop: `for`, `for-in/of`, `while`, `do-while`, Rust `loop` and `while let`, Python comprehension `for`
- every non-default `case`/arm in `switch` / `match` / Go `select`; `default`, `_`, and bare `else` arms add 0
- every `catch` / `except` clause (a `finally` adds 0)
- every conditional expression: ternary `a ? b : c`, Python `x if c else y`, comprehension `if` filter
- every short-circuit boolean operator: `&&`, `||`, `??`, Python `and`/`or`, and the assignment forms `&&=`, `||=`, `??=`
- Rust `if let`, `let … else` (counted as an `if`)

Not counted: optional chaining `?.`, Rust `?`, null assertions, `finally`,
`else`, default arms, `assert`, default parameter values, `try` itself.

### Depth

Constructs that open a level: `if`/`else` bodies, loops, `switch`/`match`, `try`
(the `try` body and every `catch`/`except`/`finally` body sit at the same level,
as in ESLint `max-depth`), Python `with`. An `else if` / `elif` chain stays at the level
of its first `if`. Conditional expressions and boolean operators do not add depth.
A nested function starts again at 0 and its body does not contribute to the
enclosing function's depth.

### Boolean operator density

`bool_ops` measures the widest single boolean expression in a function, not the
function's total. A function can sit far below the `complexity` limit and still
contain one opaque five-clause condition; cyclomatic spreads those operators
across the whole function, this metric does not.

A *boolean chain root* is a short-circuit boolean operator node (the same
operators the decision-point rules list: `&&`, `||`, `??`, Python `and`/`or`,
and the assignment forms `&&=`, `||=`, `??=`) whose parent is not itself one of
those operators. For each chain root, count every short-circuit boolean operator
in its subtree, not descending into nested function or closure bodies or into
conditional expressions.
`bool_ops` is the maximum over all chain roots in the function; a function with
no boolean operator scores 0.

Parenthesised grouping does not break a chain: `a && (b || c)` is one chain of
2. A conditional expression does break one, because a ternary is not a boolean
operator: in `(a && b) ? (c || d) : e` the two chains score 1 each.

Nested functions are measured separately, as with every other metric.

### Widget depth

`widget_depth` applies only to Dart, and only to methods named `build`. Every
other function scores 0. The existing `depth` metric counts control flow, so a
`build` method with no branching can nest ten visual layers and stay green;
this metric measures that nesting.

A *constructor-like node* is:

- a `const_object_expression` or `new_expression`; or
- a `constructor_invocation` whose type starts with an ASCII uppercase letter; or
- a call/invocation whose callee is an identifier whose first character is an
  ASCII uppercase letter (`Column(...)`); or
- a call/invocation whose callee is a member/selector expression whose leftmost
  identifier starts with an ASCII uppercase letter (`Theme.of(...)`).

Leading underscores are trimmed before the uppercase test, so a private widget
(`_Card(...)`, idiomatic for sub-widgets in a single file) counts like any
other.

A call whose callee subtree contains another call is a method chain, not a new
layer: `Text('x').animate().fadeIn()` counts once, and
`Container(child: Text('x')).animate()` counts two. Without this rule every
chain link would add a layer, which would penalise `flutter_animate` and
extension-method styles for nesting they do not create.

One known undercount, inherent to the pinned grammar: for an arrow-bodied
builder the grammar strands the returned widget inside the closure body while
its arguments dangle on an outer call, so that widget itself is not counted
(`Builder(builder: (c) => Wrapper(child: Center(child: Text('x'))))` scores 3,
where the block-bodied equivalent scores 4). The error is one-sided and
lenient, which is the safe direction for a gate.

Counting the whole expression tree would inflate the score with value
constructors — `EdgeInsets.all`, `BorderRadius.circular`, `BoxDecoration`,
`TextStyle` — which are configuration, not visual nesting. Roughly a fifth of
constructor-like nodes in a typical Flutter corpus are such values. Depth is
therefore carried only through *widget slots*:

- every positional argument of a constructor-like node; and
- every named argument whose name is in the widget-slot list below; and
- collection elements (`children: [...]`) and the bodies of closures passed
  into either of the above (`itemBuilder: (c, i) => ...`).

Widget-slot argument names:

`child`, `children`, `body`, `appBar`, `title`, `subtitle`, `leading`,
`trailing`, `icon`, `content`, `actions`, `bottomNavigationBar`,
`floatingActionButton`, `drawer`, `endDrawer`, `flexibleSpace`, `bottom`,
`header`, `footer`, `label`, `prefix`, `suffix`, `prefixIcon`, `suffixIcon`,
`separator`, `placeholder`, `builder`, `itemBuilder`, `separatorBuilder`.

Starting at 0, increment on entering a constructor-like node reached through a
widget slot, and report the maximum reached on any path. Do not descend into
nested *named* function declarations; do descend into closures passed to widget
slots. A named argument whose label is not a widget slot (`padding:`, `decoration:`,
`style:`, `duration:`) is not counted and its subtree is not traversed for this
metric. This test is applied to every named argument encountered during the
walk, not only to the arguments of a recognised constructor: the Dart grammar
leaves the argument list dangling for arrow-bodied builders
(`builder: (c) => Foo(padding: ...)`), so filtering only at the constructor
would let those subtrees through.

This is deliberately a syntactic proxy. Without type resolution the analyzer
cannot prove that `Foo(...)` returns a `Widget`; the slot restriction is what
keeps the proxy honest. Calibrated against 258 Flutter `build` methods (ConstruApp, 3d_portfolio,
pickarena): median 4, p90 6, p95 7, max 10. The default of 7 fails 6 methods
(2.3%) — the genuine outliers; a limit of 6 would fail 23 (8.9%) and 5 would
fail 48 (18.6%). Both the uppercase rule and the slot list are part of
this contract — changing either changes every score, so they change only with a
fixture update.

### Function identification

Functions are: function declarations, methods, constructors, getters/setters,
arrow functions, closures/lambdas, Python `def`/`async def`, Rust `fn` and
closures, Go `func` and function literals, Dart functions/methods/closures.

Names:

- named function/method → `name`; methods → `Type.name` when the type is known
- anonymous assigned to a binding → the binding name (`const handler = () => …` → `handler`; `foo: () => …` → `foo`)
- anonymous otherwise → `<anonymous>`
- Svelte template → `<template>` (one synthetic function per component; see Svelte)

Each function is reported once with its own metrics. Nested functions are reported
separately; their decisions and depth are excluded from the parent, their lines
are included in the parent's `lines`.

## Languages (v1)

| Language | Extensions | Grammar |
|---|---|---|
| JavaScript | `.js .mjs .cjs .jsx` | tree-sitter-javascript |
| TypeScript | `.ts .mts .cts` | tree-sitter-typescript (typescript) |
| TSX | `.tsx` | tree-sitter-typescript (tsx) |
| Svelte | `.svelte` | tree-sitter-svelte-ng (or equivalent) + TS grammar for `<script>` |
| Dart | `.dart` | tree-sitter-dart |
| Rust | `.rs` | tree-sitter-rust |
| Python | `.py .pyi` | tree-sitter-python |
| Go | `.go` | tree-sitter-go |

Anything else → `UNVERIFIED`. Grammar versions are pinned in `Cargo.toml`;
`doctor --coverage` (below) reports node kinds that look like control flow but are
not classified, so a grammar upgrade that introduces new syntax is visible.

### Svelte

- `<script>` and `<script context="module">` / `<script module>` blocks are
  parsed with the TypeScript grammar (`lang="ts"`) or JavaScript grammar. Functions
  inside are reported normally with their real line numbers in the `.svelte` file.
- The template is one synthetic function `<template>` whose decision points are
  `{#if}`, `{:else if}`, `{#each}`, `{#await}`, `{:catch}`, and the boolean /
  ternary operators inside `{…}` expressions. Depth follows block nesting.
  `<template>` is exempt from `lines` and `params`.
- Style blocks are ignored.

### Per-language notes (record any others found during implementation here)

- Rust: `match` arms count individually (a 20-arm `match` on an enum is 20). This
  is stricter than clippy's cognitive metric by design; use a repo override if a
  crate is dominated by large dispatch matches.
- Go: no ternary; `switch` with no tag counts each `case`; `select` counts each
  `case`.
- Python: `match` `case` arms count; `case _` does not. Comprehension `for` and
  `if` each count. `with` adds depth but no complexity.
- Dart: `switch` statements and switch expressions count each case; `??`, `??=`
  count; `?.` does not; cascade `..` does not.
- Svelte: `tree-sitter-svelte-ng` 1.0.2 is compatible. It exposes template
  expression contents as `svelte_raw_text`, so block structure comes from the
  grammar and boolean/ternary classification scans only those expression nodes.
- JS/TS: matches ESLint `complexity` rule semantics (including `??` and logical
  assignment); `max-depth` semantics for depth; `max-lines-per-function` with
  `skipBlankLines` + `skipComments` for lines.

## CLI

Binary: `complexity-gate`.

```
complexity-gate check [--changed] [--verbose|--summary] [--format text|json] [--config <path>] [paths…]
complexity-gate hook claude
complexity-gate hook codex
complexity-gate hook cursor
complexity-gate hook grok
complexity-gate init
complexity-gate doctor [--coverage]
complexity-gate --version
```

### `check`

- With `paths`: check those files/directories (directories recurse, honoring
  `.gitignore` and config `ignore`).
- With `--changed`: only functions touched by the working-tree diff against `HEAD`
  (staged + unstaged) plus untracked files in full. Paths are resolved against
  the repository root (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), so the result is the same
  from any cwd inside the repository; reported paths are relative to the cwd. A function is "touched" when
  its line span intersects the post-image range of any added/modified hunk. Pure
  deletions touch nothing. Outside a Git repository, or with no `HEAD`, `--changed`
  exits 2 with a short error and does not scan. Hook mode
  (`hook claude|codex|cursor|grok`) remains nonblocking: it prints a
  `note: hook skipped` line, emits no block, and a Stop resets the loop counter.
  The changed file set comes straight from Git: `git diff HEAD` post-image paths
  (which already include tracked files that a later `.gitignore` rule covers)
  plus untracked files from `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`; config
  `ignore` applies before any language lookup, so ignored paths never appear as
  `UNVERIFIED`. Explicit paths are normalized (`.`/`..`) before intersecting.
  Non-UTF-8 diff output is decoded lossily; hunk headers are ASCII. Git is invoked with
  `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv`, external diff, textconv, fsmonitor, and hooks
  disabled, and `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`/`GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF`/`GIT_CONFIG_*`
  removed from its environment.
- `--changed` and explicit `paths` together: intersection (changed functions within
  those paths).
- Text output for explicit paths is detailed by default, one line per violation,
  sorted by file then line. `--verbose` selects the same output explicitly and
  never prints passing functions. With `--changed`, `--verbose` requires at least
  one explicit file and rejects directories:

```
FAIL src/auth.ts:42 authenticate  complexity 18 > 15
FAIL src/auth.ts:42 authenticate  depth 5 > 4
UNVERIFIED src/Foo.kt  no grammar for .kt
```

- Text output for `--changed` is summarized by default. `--summary` requests the
  same output for explicit paths. It reports total failing files, functions,
  violations, and unverified files; lists failing paths before unverified paths;
  caps the combined list at 20 paths; reports the omitted count; and ends with a
  scoped `DETAILS` command. Clean output is empty and never prints `PASS`:

```
FAIL 2 changed files, 3 functions, 4 violations
UNVERIFIED 1 changed file
FAIL src/auth.ts  2 functions, 3 violations
FAIL src/order.ts  1 function, 1 violation
UNVERIFIED src/Foo.kt  no grammar for .kt
DETAILS complexity-gate check --changed --verbose <file>
```

  `--summary` and `--verbose` conflict with each other and with `--format json`.

- Output `json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.1",
  "checked": 12,
  "violations": [
    {"file": "src/auth.ts", "line": 42, "function": "authenticate",
     "metric": "complexity", "value": 18, "limit": 15}
  ],
  "unverified": [{"file": "src/Foo.kt", "reason": "no grammar for .kt"}]
}
```

- Exit codes: `0` no violations; `1` at least one violation; `2` usage or runtime
  error (bad config, unreadable path). `UNVERIFIED` alone never fails.
- `UNVERIFIED` is emitted for a file that is explicitly named on the command
  line, or that has a known source-code extension with no grammar (`.kt .java
  .c .cc .cpp .h .hpp .cs .swift .rb .php .scala .lua .zig .m .mm .ex .exs .hs
  .clj .sh .bash .pl .r`), or that cannot be decoded as UTF-8. Non-source files
  found while walking a directory (`.md`, `.json`, `.toml`, images, …) are
  skipped silently. A file that cannot be read never aborts the scan.

### `hook claude`

Reads the Claude Code hook JSON from stdin and dispatches on `hook_event_name`:

- `PostToolUse` with `tool_name` `Edit`, `Write`, or `MultiEdit` checks
  `<tool_input.file_path>`. On violations it prints JSON
  `{"decision":"block","reason":"<summary>"}` and exits 0. The summary follows
  the same 20-path cap and returns feedback without undoing the edit. No
  violations produce no output.
- `Stop` → `check --changed` in `cwd`. On violations print a compact, 20-path-capped
  report in `{"decision":"block","reason":"<summary>Fix the listed files, then
  finish."}` and exit 0, which prevents the
  agent from stopping. Loop guard: consecutive blocks per `session_id` are counted
  in the state directory. The hook blocks at most `hook.max_blocks` times
  (default 3); every later Stop with violations is allowed and prints the compact report
  prefixed with `UNRESOLVED` to stderr, exit 0. Only a clean run resets the
  counter (an `UNRESOLVED` release does not). State file names derive from a
  sanitized `session_id`, never from a toolchain-dependent hash.
- Any other event → exit 0, no output. Missing optional fields (`session_id`,
  `cwd`) never cause a non-zero exit: `cwd` defaults to the process cwd and a
  missing `session_id` uses an unkeyed counter.
- Never exit non-zero from the hook for gate results; reserve non-zero for
  runtime errors, with a one-line stderr message.

Field names follow the current Claude Code hooks documentation; verify against the
docs during implementation and record the version checked in `docs/hooks.md`.

### `hook codex`

Same semantics, reading the Codex hooks JSON. Codex's event names and output
contract differ; implement the closest equivalents (post-edit feedback, stop
block) per the current Codex hooks documentation and record the mapping and
limitations in `docs/hooks.md`. Where Codex cannot block a stop, the hook must
still return the report as feedback.

### `hook cursor`

Reads Cursor's native hook JSON. `afterFileEdit` checks the top-level
`file_path`; findings are written to stderr because that event is passive.
`stop` checks changed functions when `status` is `completed` and returns a
`followup_message` on violations. Aborted and failed stops are ignored. The
working directory comes from the first `workspace_roots` entry or
`CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR`.

### `hook grok`

Reads Grok's native camel-case hook JSON. `post_tool_use` checks edits and writes
findings to stderr for the hook annotation. `stop` checks changed functions and
blocks with exit 2 and the report on stderr. The working directory comes from
`workspaceRoot` or `GROK_WORKSPACE_ROOT`.

### `init`

Writes `.complexity-gate.json` in the current directory containing the effective
defaults, for repo-level overrides. Refuses to overwrite an existing file (exit 2).

### `doctor`

Prints: binary version, config resolution chain with the effective values, state
directory, and each language → grammar version. `--coverage` additionally lists,
per grammar, node kinds whose name contains `if`, `for`, `while`, `loop`, `match`,
`switch`, `case`, `catch`, `except`, `conditional`, `ternary`, `binary`, or
`logical` that the language table neither counts nor explicitly ignores.

## Configuration

Resolution, later wins, shallow merge per top-level key:

1. built-in defaults (`config.default.json`, embedded)
2. user: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/complexity-gate/config.json` (default `~/.config/complexity-gate/config.json`)
3. repo: nearest `.complexity-gate.json` walking up from the checked file's
   directory — always per file, also under `--changed`, so nested packages can
   carry their own limits
4. `--config <path>` replaces step 3

```json
{
  "limits": { "complexity": 15, "depth": 4, "lines": 100, "params": 6 },
  "tests": {
    "patterns": ["**/*.test.*", "**/*.spec.*", "**/*_test.go", "**/test_*.py",
                 "**/*_test.py", "**/*_test.dart", "**/test/**", "**/tests/**",
                 "**/__tests__/**"],
    "exempt": ["lines"]
  },
  "ignore": ["**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/build/**", "**/target/**",
             "**/.svelte-kit/**", "**/*.g.dart", "**/*.freezed.dart",
             "**/*.min.js", "**/generated/**"],
  "languages": {},
  "hook": { "max_blocks": 3 }
}
```

`tests.patterns` and `ignore` globs match paths relative to the Git repository
root (or to the common scan root outside Git), never to the process cwd.
`tests.exempt` accepts only `lines`; `hook.max_blocks` is clamped to at least 1.
A repo config is trusted like any repo file. Under `--changed`, when a
`.complexity-gate.json` is itself among the changed files the report starts with
`note: .complexity-gate.json changed in this diff` so a reviewer sees it.

`languages.<name>.limits` overrides limits for one language (`javascript`,
`typescript`, `svelte`, `dart`, `rust`, `python`, `go`). Unknown keys → exit 2
with the key named.

## State

Loop-guard counters live in `~/.pickforge/complexity-gate/` (override with
`COMPLEXITY_GATE_HOME`), per the Pickforge local-storage policy. Nothing is ever
written into the checked repository except by `init`.

## Golden fixtures

`tests/fixtures/<language>/` holds source files plus `expected.json`
(`[{function, line, complexity, depth, lines, params}]`). Each language has at
least: one trivial function, one function at exactly the limit, one over each
limit, nested functions, every decision-point kind listed above for that language,
and (Svelte) a template with nested blocks.

Reference numbers are derived once from the reference tool and recorded in the
fixture's `expected.json` under `reference` with the tool name and version:
ESLint or Oxlint `complexity` for JS/TS/TSX and Svelte scripts (the same rule
implementation; either is accepted, record which), `radon` for Python, `gocyclo`
for Go, `lizard` for Rust, hand-derived with a per-line comment for Dart and
Svelte templates. Every function in `expected.json` has a reference entry; when
the reference tool does not report a function (nested or anonymous), the entry
is marked `hand_derived` with its derivation. A
test asserts `reference <= ours <= reference + delta` for complexity on every
fixture, where `delta` is recorded per function in the reference entry with the reason
(default 0), plus exact equality with our own committed expectations. Every
language fixture includes a multi-branch `else if` chain, a `try`/`catch`, an
operator inside a string literal, and an anonymous callback inside a named
function.

## Repository gates

Per the Pickforge gate baseline: `cargo test --workspace --locked --all-targets`;
`cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` with `clippy.toml`
`cognitive-complexity-threshold = 15` and `too_many_lines` denied at 100;
`cargo llvm-cov` line floor at the ratchet (actual, rounded down); gitleaks and
osv-scanner jobs; `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2` in every workflow including release;
`cargo-dist` release workflow producing linux-x86_64, linux-aarch64,
macos-aarch64, macos-x86_64, windows-x86_64 archives with checksums. The binary
gates itself: CI runs `complexity-gate check crates` and fails on violations.
